# CosmoPMC
Cosmology sampling with Population Monte Carlo (PMC)

## Information

### Description

CosmoPMC is a Monte-Carlo sampling method to explore the likelihood of various
cosmological probes. The sampling engine is implemented with the package
pmclib. It is called Population MonteCarlo (PMC), which is a novel technique to
sample from the posterior (Cappé et al. 2008). PMC is an adaptive importance
sampling method which iteratively improves the proposal to approximate the
posterior. This code has been introduced, tested and applied to various
cosmology data sets in Wraith, Kilbinger, Benabed et al. (2009). Results on the
Bayesian evidence using PMC are discussed in Kilbinger, Wraith, Benabed et al.
(2010).
